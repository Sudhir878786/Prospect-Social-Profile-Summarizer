Full Name: Priyansh Agarwal
Occupation: Founder and Educator at TLE Eliminators
Heading: Founder - TLE Eliminators | ICPC World Finalist | AIR 1 - Google Kick Start | Former Intern @Goldman Sachs | IIIT Delhi'23
Summary: I am a final year undergrad at IIIT Delhi pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Goldman Sachs for 8 weeks. As an intern, I primarily worked on optimising various programs leading to significant runtime reductions and database read-write costs. 

I am highly interested in algorithmic problem solving and have a firm grasp in data structures and algorithms. In my three years of experience of both practicing and teaching competitive programming, I have climbed up to the top 0.2% competitive programmers in India with some remarkable achievements such as: 
- Global Rank 6 and India Rank 1 in Google Kick Start 2022
- India Rank of 20 in ICPC (aka Olympics of Coding) Regionals 2021. 

I have also interned as a Problem Tester at Relevel wherein I verified the correctness of over 500 coding problems which were included in the all India hiring tests conducted on their platform. 

I also received the Dean's Award in technical category for having shown the most exceptional performances in national and international programming competitions at IIIT Delhi in 2020-21. 

I am an Android Development enthusiast and have made quite a few apps in Java using Android Studio and Firebase. I am currently learning more about Kotlin and Flutter.

In an attempt to give back to the programming community I also run a Youtube channel with over 32k subscribers along with India's biggest Competitive Programming community on Discord.
