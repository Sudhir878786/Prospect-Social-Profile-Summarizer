I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Goldman Sachs for 8 weeks. As an intern, I primarily worked on optimising various programs leading to significant runtime reductions and database read-write costs. \n\nI am highly interested in algorithmic problem solving and have a firm grasp in data structures and algorithms. In my three years of experience of both practicing and teaching competitive programming, I have climbed up to the top 0.2% competitive programmers in India with some remarkable achievements such as: \n- Global Rank 6 and India Rank 1 in Google Kick Start 2022\n- India Rank of 20 in ICPC (aka Olympics of Coding) Regionals 2021. \n\nI have also interned as a Problem Tester at Relevel wherein I verified the correctness of over 500 coding problems which were included in the all India hiring tests conducted on their platform. \n\nI also received the Dean's Award in technical category for having shown the most exceptional performances in national and international programming competitions at IIIT Delhi in 2020-21. \n\nI am an Android Development enthusiast and have made quite a few apps in Java using Android Studio and Firebase. I am currently learning more about Kotlin and Flutter.\n\nIn an attempt to give back to the programming community I also run a Youtube channel with over 32k subscribers along with India's biggest Competitive Programming community on Discord.", "country": "IN", "country_full_name": "India", "city": "South Delhi", "state": "Delhi", "experiences": [{"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 9, "year": 2022}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 9, "year": 2022}, "company": "Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar ", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/school/indian-institute-of-technology-gandhinagar-iitgn-/", "title": "Competitive Programming Educator", "description": "- Conducted a 7 days workshop on Dynamic Programming at IIT Gandhinagar.\n- Taught 6 online lectures covering various concepts in DP to 200+ students.\n- Conducted an offline problem-solving lecture.\nThe lecture recordings can be found here: https://youtu.be/G-uriCpjSOA", "location": "Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India", "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHtgpskaCA9tg/company-logo_400_400/0/1519905300544?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=Dyd3rAyBu1uCfiHZmvXO-OHRbSxaJHvPhmX7SO8AU_I"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 5, "year": 2022}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 7, "year": 2022}, "company": "Goldman Sachs", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/goldman-sachs/", "title": "Software Engineer Intern", "description": "Team: One Delta Engineering - Global Markets Division\n- Parallelised 60+ test scripts, reducing the runtime from over 8 hours to 5 minutes. \n- Optimised a reference data system saving over 85% time to process live updates.", "location": "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India", "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQHm5bYK6emQSg/company-logo_400_400/0/1595518030728?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=BZcx3G63UpljpcDHat76J2CORt2-uVhSHNlbw6RX79M"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 7, "year": 2021}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2022}, "company": "Relevel by Unacademy", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/relevelhq/", "title": "DSA Problem Tester", "description": "Relevel is a platform that conducts online coding tests for various tech companies.\n- Tested and verified the correctness of over 500 programming problems.\n- Designed an exhaustive set of test cases for each problem.", "location": "Remote", "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQH5jL86yp2VUQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1662557186215?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=OQGz7RWuRS8CRUAyAYDwrhixj3GysbC9rF3KZaKeTG0"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2021}, "ends_at": null, "company": "TLE Eliminators", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/tle-eliminators/", "title": "Founder and Educator", "description": "TLE Eliminators is a community-driven company that provides Competitive Programming training. \n- Running India's biggest competitive programming community on Discord.\n- Leading a team of 45+ people.\n- Taught competitive programming to 2000+ students in the last 15 months.", "location": "New Delhi, Delhi, India", "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQEWnhVyOTRHnw/company-logo_400_400/0/1669025184398?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=93uABRq1PICYhCXmVg0TNrjNYLsW6BZYssAfFV2FT98"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2020}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 8, "year": 2020}, "company": "Coding Ninjas India", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/codingninjas/", "title": "Teaching Assistant (Competitive Programming)", "description": "Coding Ninjas is an EdTech company providing coding classes for school and college students.\n- Conducted doubt resolution and code debugging sessions for a competitive programming course.\n- Assisted over 120 students in their projects and assignments.", "location": "India", "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHgco5CcYbB8g/company-logo_400_400/0/1659000490526?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=WmPxs2eMD6AKJlRbl7DJp_cfVqTIC3DJrTBdflJK2a8"}], "education": [{"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 8, "year": 2019}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 5, "year": 2023}, "field_of_study": "Computer Science Engineering", "degree_name": "Bachelor of Technology - BTech", "school": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi", "school_linkedin_profile_url": null, "description": null, "logo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQG8G8yRaFuoBQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1519863887737?e=1692835200&v=beta&t=A4CFaqRnrytv3wyomt1GC1fwVi1Y8L8iirRsU66xOAE", "grade": null, "activities_and_societies": null}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2017}, "ends_at": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2019}, "field_of_study": "CBSE", "degree_name": null, "school": "Delhi Public School - R.
